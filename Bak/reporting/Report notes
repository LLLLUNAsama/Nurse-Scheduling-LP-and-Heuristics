Report notes



How the instances have been selected?

- execute some wide range of parameters
- then for times between 0 and the time limit (usually 300 seconds) explore the surface response of different values of parameters
- Plot the evolution of solving time by Integer variables
	-> increases with num of integer variables but also has variability
	-> the maximum time for a size of integer variables increases
- Plot the evolution of solving time by instance configuration (parameters)
	-> clearly exponential increment
