Greedy cost ideas

sum for each nurse in the solution
	maxHours - sum hours (penalizes unused work capacity)
	maxPresence - presence hours (penalizes concentration of work hours)

sum of squares:
	for each work hour:
		sum the square of (demand[h] - work[h])
		-> penalizes unadjustment 

building blocks
	z for Nurse that works or not
	w(n,h) for Nurse n wotking at h

	output of Greedy cost
		set of w[n,h] matrices, sorted by greedy cost -> NO!



Local search ideas

	N(s) change one nurse from working nurses to non working nurses? composite idea
	N(s) change wnh to another wmh? but then a lot of constraints must be taken into consideration
