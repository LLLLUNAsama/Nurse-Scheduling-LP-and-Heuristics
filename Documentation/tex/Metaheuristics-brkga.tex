\subsection{BRKGA implementation}

A brief context of the BRKGA metaheuristic algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
	\item acronym
	\item building blocks / components
	\item intensification, diversification and strategy applied
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Chromosome structure}

This paragraph shows the pseudocode of our BRKGA model for the problem of interest.

After the pseudocode is shown, brief comments of each line should be added.



\subsubsection{Decoder}

Tests performed to determine if the model is correct. Results obtained (very brief)
