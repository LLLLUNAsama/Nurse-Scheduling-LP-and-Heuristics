Write the context of the Project:  mixed integer linear programming (SIMPLEX and branch and cut) and metaheuristics algorithms to model and solve mathematical problems.\\

The motivation: to model, implement and test each of the models applied to a problem.\\

Introduce the problem (copy from assignment).\\

Explain the outcomes of the project: 3 models of the problem, time comparison of MILP versus Metaheuristics, Comparison of the 2 Metaheuristics.\\
