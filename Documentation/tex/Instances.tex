\subsection{Instance generation}

This section shows how the instances have been generated. Possibly adding a very schematic pseudocode of our generation algorithm.\\

This section also explains the sets of instances that are prepared for the project:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item small-medium set: used to compare the solving time of the ILP model versus the Metaheuristics models
	\item large set: used to test the Metaheuristics models parameters over a large set of instances in order the choose the best performing setup for each model.
\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{Instance generation}

pseudocode\\
comments\\
how feasibility is assured\\
tests on how to increment solving time, including some graphs with the Best Integer and Best Bound evolution for different variations of the same instance\\
Conclusion on how to increase the "size" of the instance without computing the solving time of the ILP model.

\subsubsection{Medium Set}

Composition of the set, number of instances and solving times.

\subsubsection{Large Set}

Composition of the set, number of instances, solving times or another measure of the size of the problem.
