\subsection{Comparison: GRASP vs BRKGA}

Test of the section: parameter selection for each model, model performance comparision with best parameter setup.


\subsubsection{Tuning GRASP parameters}


Setup of the tests:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item instances set
	\item execution conditions (same computer)
	\item procedure
	\item results and times gathering procedure
\end{itemize}


Graph of alpha\\
Graph of Iterations\\
Graph of best improvement vs first improvement?\\

\subsubsection{Tuning BRKGA parameters}


Setup of the tests:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item instances set
	\item execution conditions (same computer)
	\item procedure
	\item results and times gathering procedure
\end{itemize}


Graph of iheritance probability\\
Graph of elite proportion\\
Graph of mutant proportion\\
Graph of population size\\
Graph of number of generations\\

\subsubsection{Comparative results of meta-heuristics performance}

Choosing the best performing parameter setup of the two models, perform a comparison of how objective function evolves in relation to time.

Draw conclusions about, why one is better than the other, why one stops sooner than the other. (think in terms of diversification and intensification and solution space exploration)\\
